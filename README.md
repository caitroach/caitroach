## hi, i'm cait! 🪳
I'm a compsci undergrad at Queen's interested in cybersecurity, bioinformatics, ML, and web dev. This account is both a portfolio and a learning log: I keep finished projects and experimental repos here.

### stuff I do
- **computational biology + ML**
  - computer vision for diagnostics
  - neural nets for immunotherapy design
  - live pose estimation
 
- **cybersecurity**
  - learning C, assembly, and legacy systems to understand how stuff breaks
  - interested in defensive tooling and vulnerabilities

 - **just 4 fun**
   - hackathons with friends
   - making cute indie sites
   - stupid chrome extensions
  
### stuff I use
- **comfortable**: Python, Java, HTML/CSS
- **learning**: C, Assembly, COBOL, Bash
- **tools**: TensorFlow, keras, MediaPipe, pywebview, epitope-predict

I try to cite my sources & tutorials and will update READMEs as I go along! Reach out at **roachc006@gmail.com** if you wanna talk :D
